Below is a brief description of the model mentioned in "image_embedding_script.py"

The **ViT-B/16 (Vision Transformer Base with 16x16 patches)** is a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. It splits an input image into non-overlapping patches of size 16x16, treats each patch as a "token" (similar to words in NLP), and applies transformer layers to model the relationships between these patches.

Key points:
- **Base model**: The "B" in the name refers to the base-sized model, which has 12 transformer layers and 86 million parameters.
- **16x16 patches**: The model divides the input image into patches of 16x16 pixels.
- **Transformer architecture**: Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT processes images without convolutions, instead using self-attention to capture global image features.
- **Pretrained on ImageNet**: ViT models are often pretrained on large datasets like ImageNet and can be fine-tuned for various downstream vision tasks.

ViT-B/16 is known for strong performance on image classification tasks, especially when pretrained on large datasets.

Below is a brief description of each of the models mentioned in "image_embedding_script_modified.py" 

1. **Swin Transformer (Shifted Window Transformer)**:
   - Uses hierarchical feature maps and shifted windows for efficient and scalable vision tasks.
   - Scales well from small to large images and is known for its high accuracy on vision benchmarks.

2. **DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer)**:
   - A version of the Vision Transformer (ViT) optimized to work efficiently with smaller datasets.
   - Introduces a distillation token during training, allowing the model to learn from a teacher network.

3. **BEiT (BERT Pre-trained Image Transformer)**:
   - Inspired by BERT, BEiT is trained using masked image modeling, where parts of the image are masked, and the model predicts the missing patches.
   - Excellent at transfer learning, similar to how BERT is used in NLP tasks.

4. **CvT (Convolutional Vision Transformer)**:
   - Combines the benefits of convolutional networks with transformers, using convolutions to generate tokens.
   - More efficient than standard vision transformers, especially for high-resolution images.

5. **PiT (Pooling-based Vision Transformer)**:
   - Uses pooling layers, similar to CNNs, to reduce the computational cost of transformers.
   - Retains spatial hierarchies and reduces the overall number of tokens as it progresses deeper into the network.

6. **CaiT (Class-Attention in Image Transformers)**:
   - Adds class-attention layers at the end of a transformer, allowing the model to focus on specific object classes.
   - Achieves state-of-the-art performance on many vision tasks by focusing on better class representation.

7. **CoAtNet (Convolution and Attention Network)**:
   - Combines the strengths of convolution and attention mechanisms for better performance and efficiency.
   - Achieves high accuracy with fewer computational resources compared to pure transformers.

8. **LeViT (Levitated Transformer)**:
   - A hybrid model that combines convolutional and transformer layers, designed for fast inference.
   - Well-suited for mobile and edge devices due to its efficiency in terms of speed and memory usage.

9. **T2T-ViT (Tokens-to-Token Vision Transformer)**:
   - Improves tokenization by using recursive token embedding, where tokens represent increasingly large image patches.
   - Better at preserving local image structures and achieving higher accuracy compared to traditional transformers.
